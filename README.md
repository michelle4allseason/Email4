Hi Frank,

Hope you are having a great week! 

My name is Michelle Sunga, School Program Coordinator of **CodePath**, an organization headquartered in San Francisco that provides free, accelerated mobile engineering classes for professional developers. I am writing because we are offering a FREE training course at the **University of Washington** on ***Introduction to iOS for New Coders*** in Spring 2018.

Over the past couple years, CodePath has specialized in accelerating the time it takes professionals to learn new technologies through enjoyable, project based programming classes. Starting with free classes three years ago, CodePath has now taught thousands of engineers and is changing the way companies hire, train, and keep great engineers for many of the world's top technology. CodePath's curriculum is also taught in more than 20 universities and across multiple countries including Haiti and Taiwan.

The goal of this course is fairly simple - we want to ramp you up on everything you need to know about iOS development in just 12 weeks. The Practical iOS course for university is built from the same curriculum we use to train professional engineers on-site at Facebook, [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/codepath-partnership/), Airbnb, Lyft and many other Silicon Valley companies. We are confident that anyone that completes the course will be able to comfortably build any app apart from games. Check out this [blog post by Charlie](https://blog.codepath.com/2016/06/14/an-experiment-across-17-universities-shows-the-secret-to-diversifying-the-tech-industry/) for outstanding examples. We have had many alumni transition to full-time iOS engineering roles smoothly after completing this program. This course also helps prepare you for real life technical interviews that you will want to ace to work at Silicon Valley companies.

We believe the best education in the world should be freely accessible and weâ€™ve been fortunate to work with great companies like Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Box, and others to help make this vision a reality. We are committed to bringing our in-person classes and approach to high-quality technical curriculum to colleges in the world and offer them for free. Please visit this [link](http://codepath.com/about) to learn more on why we are doing this.

Thanks and look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,

Michelle Sunga
